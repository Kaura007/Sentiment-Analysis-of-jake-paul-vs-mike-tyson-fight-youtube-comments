üìä Data Source
The project utilized a dataset of YouTube comments about the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson trailer, taken from Kaggle. The data was pre-labeled for supervised learning, containing text and corresponding sentiment labels, as well as emotion-based scores.

A sample of the dataset showing the columns and data types.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
Data Acquisition & Loading: The dataset was loaded and explored to understand its structure and content, including 17 different columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed initial analysis to identify class distribution, text length, and common words.

Text Preprocessing: The text data was cleaned by removing duplicates and unnecessary columns (published_at, author).

Feature Engineering: Text data was transformed into numerical features using word counts.

Model Training: A supervised learning model was trained to classify the sentiment.

Model Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated on a held-out test set using a confusion matrix and classification report.

üìà Results & Visualizations
The sentiment analysis revealed a high level of neutral and positive comments, with a lower percentage of negative comments. This suggests a generally positive or indifferent reaction to the trailer.

The distribution of sentiment across all comments.

Key Insights
Dominant Emotions: The most prominent emotions detected in the comments were negative, anger, positive, and fear.

Engagement: Comments with a positive sentiment received a significantly higher average number of likes compared to neutral and negative comments, indicating that positive opinions are more engaging.
